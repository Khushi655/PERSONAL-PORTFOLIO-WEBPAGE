*DESCRIPTION*: This portfolio website is a personal project I created to introduce myself, showcase my work, and demonstrate the skills I’ve been learning in web development. I built it from the ground up using HTML and CSS, keeping the design clean, simple, and easy to navigate.
The goal of this portfolio was not just to complete an assignment or tick off a project on a to-do list. I wanted to create something I could proudly share — a space that feels authentic to who I am as a learner and a creator. Building this site gave me an opportunity to combine what I’ve been studying with my creativity and design sense.
The homepage of the site serves as a friendly and professional introduction. The aim here was to make the site welcoming, easy to browse, and informative.
When you first land on the site, you’ll see a short introduction about who I am and what I do. I wanted it to feel welcoming and professional, giving visitors a quick idea of what the site is about without overwhelming them. From there, the site flows into an “About Me” section, where I share more about my background, interests, and what inspired me to start learning web development. It's a small glimpse into my personality and the passion I have for creating and building things on the web.
One of the most important parts of the site is the “Projects” section. This is where I showcase some of the work I’ve done so far — whether it’s small websites, creative layouts, or assignments I’ve enjoyed working on. Each project includes a short description and, where possible, a link or visual preview. This section represents my progress and growth, and I plan to keep adding to it as I build more.
The “Skills” section highlights the tools and technologies I’m currently learning, such as HTML, CSS, and some design basics. I kept it simple and honest — just a clear overview of where I am in my learning journey and what I can bring to the table right now. Over time, I’ll keep updating this section as I pick up new skills and tools.
Styling the site was one of my favourite parts. I used CSS to create a layout that works well across different devices, from desktops to mobile phones. I focused on making the design look clean and readable, with good use of spacing, fonts, and colours. I also added some hover effects and subtle animations to make the site feel more interactive and alive.
At the end of the site, there’s a “Contact” section. I included a simple way for people to reach out — whether it’s for feedback, collaboration, or just to connect. I want the site to be not just a showcase, but also a way to build connections and opportunities.
Overall, this portfolio is something I’m really proud of. It’s more than just a school task or a coding exercise — it reflects my effort, my creativity, and my excitement to keep learning and growing in this field. For this project I have referred google,youtube and chatgpt.
